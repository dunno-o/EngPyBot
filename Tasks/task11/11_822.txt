  Elephants sense ‘danger’ clothes St Andrews University researchers discovered that elephants could recognise the degree of danger posed by various groups of individuals. The study found that African elephants always reacted with fear A ______ previously worn by men of the Maasai tribe. They are known to demonstrate their courage by В ______ .The elephants also responded aggressively to red clothing, which defines traditional Maasai dress.However, the elephants showed a much milder reaction to clothing previously worn by the Kamba people, С ______ and pose little threat.The researchers first presented elephants with clean, red clothing and with red clothing that had been worn for five days by D ______ .They revealed that Maasai-smelt clothing motivated elephants to travel significantly faster in the first minute after they moved away.They then investigated whether elephants could also use the colour of clothing as a cue to classify a potential threat and found the elephants reacted with aggression E ______ . This suggested that they associated the colour red with the Maasai.The researchers believe the distinction in the elephants’ emotional reaction to smell and colour might be explained by F ______ . They might be able to distinguish among different human groups according to the level of risk they posed.«We regard this experiment as just a start to investigating precisely how elephants ‘see the world’, and it may be that their abilities will turn out to equal or exceed those of our closer relatives, the monkeys and apes,» researchers added.
