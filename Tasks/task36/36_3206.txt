Mexico City
Mexico City was hot and frantic with Olympic gamesmanship. The hotels were full but, fortunately, Kevin owned a country house just outside the city which we 30 ______ our headquarters. The Whites also had their home in Mexico City but they were more often than not at Kevin’s private palace.I must 31 ______ that when Kevin decided to move he moved fast. Like a good general, he marshalled his army close to the point of impact; he spent a small fortune on telephone calls and 32 ______ in getting all we needed for the expedition in the shortest time possible. I had a fast decision to make, too. My job was a good one and I hated to give it 33 ______  unceremoniously, but Kevin was pushing hard. I 34 ______ my boss and he was good enough to give me six months’ leave of absence. I deceived him in a way, I gave him the right destination but not the real reason for going there. Yet I think that going to Yucatan could be understood as looking 35 ______ my father’s estate.Kevin also used resources that only money can buy. The thought of it made me a bit dizzy. Kevin was able to lift a telephone and set a private police force in motion. It made me open my eyes and think again. There was something about Kevin that got at me. Whatever it was, I preferred to keep it bottled up. Will I 36 ______ it in the future?
