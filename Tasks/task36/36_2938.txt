Virtual High School  
Christina C. was determined to graduate from high school. Yet, being not a driven student she faced numerous hurdles , leading to frustration. At that point, a school administrator told Christina about a new public schooling 30 _____ –Youth Connection Charter School (YCCS) Virtual High School – that could be a path to graduation.Christina chose the combination of Virtual High School's online instruction coupled with the support from classroom teachers. This hybrid education model 31 _____her to take online courses at home and attend some lessons at school."When I found out about this program, my mother said it was a good idea and told me she would help me get 32 _____ it. The school even provided bus 33 _____ so I could attend – and it was the best decision," she said."It was hard for me to adjust but taking the classes on the computer gave me a chance to study at my own 34 _____," said Christina.The online courses also relieved the pressure Christina often felt in a traditional classroom. "Sometimes I was hesitant to let a teacher know I didn't understand something. Because there were so many students, I couldn't get the individual attention I needed. The online courses really take the pressure off because you can 35 _____ your time till you understand it all," she explained.This past June, Christina, aged 19, graduated from High School and her academic success and newfound confidence spurred her to apply – and to be accepted – to Trinity Christian College, with a partial scholarship."I was shocked ... Here I was ready to give up, and I graduated with As. I can go to college and make my dreams 36 _____true," she said.
