Dinner
Amos Finnister was a private detective. In all his years as a policeman and a private investigator, he had learned about people. He gained a psychological insight into most as he 30 ______ them do foolish things. He was at ease with people from all walks of life, and in consequence they were at ease with him. And this was most apparent on Friday evening, when Major Cedric Crawford dined with him at the Ritz restaurant. Amos 31 ______ to dine there when he lived in New York. By the time they were halfway through dinner, Amos had the major laughing and sharing stories, some of which were funny. By the time they had eaten the main course, Amos felt comfortable enough to 32 ______ the answer to an important question. “I wonder if you have ever come across Tabitha James.” Cedric 33 ______ knowing Tabitha with no sign of embarrassment or reluctance. “To 34 ______ the truth, I knew her quite well, actually. She was a close friend of a fellow guards officer, Sebastian Lawford. She fell in love with him at first sight. They were going to marry but unfortunately that did not come to pass.” “And why was that, Major, do you know?”“Oh, yes, I’m afraid I do. Tabitha had contracted pneumonia but 35 ______ no attention to her illness. Before I knew it, she was dead and gone. As for Sebastian, he rejoined the army when the war broke out and was killed. A sad story, isn’t it?” Amos nodded. So much depended 36 ______ this information.
