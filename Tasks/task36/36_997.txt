We hated to leave her, but the idea was that somebody must stay to 30 ______ care of the house. But this didn’t work well. No matter how few the substitute’s faults were, Father had no patience with them.

He ate heartily, but he said he didn’t feel nourished. At last Mother had to 35 ______ that it was impossible to go on like this. “This is Delia’s last night. I do hope you will like Tobo, they say, he is a very good cook.” The next night, Father found out, that the first dish was too Oriental and the meat underdone. So Mother sent for Margaret. She knew she could always depend 36 ______ Margaret.
