A night at the Museum Anna and Ira are best friends. They are both Russian but 30 ______ the Southbank International School as their parents both work in London. They are fifteen now and are studying hard for their International Baccalaureate. Every Saturday they love to visit museums and galleries in London and so now they have visited 31 ______ all of them. But, above all, their absolute favourite is The Natural History Museum in South Kensington. They filled in an online 32 ______ form and became “members”. This means they get free magazines called “Evolve” and “Second Nature”, get fast track entry to special exhibitions and they get invited to previews, workshops, talks and special 33 ______ They even get to use the special member’s room where there are free refreshments, magazines and internet access. It 34 ______ them £56 for the year but they felt it was really good value for money. Last weekend they took part in “Dino snores”  — an event 35 ______ by the film “A Night at the Museum”. They were given a talk about bugs by TV nature presenter Nick Baker, explored the Dinosaur gallery in the dark on a torch-lit tour, watched films and played games, and then slept in sleeping bags under the shadow of the huge Diplodocus in the Museum's iconic Central Hall. It was a night they’ll never forget. Although Ira and Anna are both interested in Dinosaurs  — they are more interested in present day wildlife and most interested of all in 36 ______ Russian wildlife. When they go back to Moscow both want to study and eventually become wildlife research scientists.
