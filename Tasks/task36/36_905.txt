Mark’s Visit to Ravenscar
Mark and. Fenella were the first to arrive at Ravenscar. Mark had not been to Ravenscar for a long time, but even so he had not forgotten the spectacular 30 ______ from the library windows. As he and Fenella were ushered into the room by Cecily Deravenel, he 31 ______ his best not to rush over to the windows to enjoy the view. “It’s lovely to see you both,” Cecily was 32 ______ , and then her face broke into smiles. “Ah, here’s Bess, your greatest admirer, Fenella. And Nanny with the other children.” A moment later Fenella and Cecily were surrounded by the youngsters, all clamoring for attention, and Mark took the opportunity to walk to the other end of the room. Mark always thought that 33 ______ up children was so boring. Turning around Mark allowed his eyes to sweep the room for an admiring moment, taking in long shelves of books, several memorable paintings, and the handsome antiques, made of dark, ripe woods. There were 34 ______ sofas and chairs arranged near the huge stone fireplace. 35 ______ the warm weather, a log fire was blazing. It was a pleasure to be in such a nice room. His eyes settled on Fenella, who was momentarily preoccupied with the youngsters, and he had to admit he had never seen such beautiful children in his life. They might have just stepped out of a portrait by one of the greatest artists of the eighteenth century, Thomas Gainsborough, George Romney, Sir Joshua Reynolds. Suddenly he 36 ______ he	had had children.
