The Silver Jubilee 
The Silver Jubilee of King George V and Queen Mary in 1935 was celebrated by everyone at Trumper’s. There were various posters and pictures of the royal couple in every shop window, and Tom Arnold ran a competition to see which shop could come up with the most imaginative display to 30 ______ the occasion.Charlie 31 ______ charge of Number 147, which he still looked upon as his personal kingdom, and with the help of Bob Making’s daughter, who was in her first year at the Chelsea School of Art, they produced a model of the King and Queen made from every fruit and vegetable that hailed from the British Empire.Charles was angry when the judges - the colonel and the Marchioness of Wiltshire, awarded Number 147 second place 32 ______ the flower shop, which was doing a roaring trade selling bunches of red, white and blue chrysanthemums. What had put them in the first place was a vast map of the world made 33 ____ entirely of flowers, with the British Empire set in red roses.Charles gave all the office 34 ______ the day off and he escorted Becky and Daniel up to the mall at four-thirty in the morning so that they could find a good vantage point to watch the King and Queen proceed from Buckingham Palace to St. Paul’s Cathedral, where a service of thanksgiving was to be conducted.They 35 ______ at the mall only to discover that thousands of people were already covering every inch of the pavements with sleeping bags, blankets and tents. Charles knew he could only depend 36 ______ his luck to find a spare place.
