The Chameleon Stone 
That morning Tanon, a young farmer’s boy, discovered a strange stone in the cattle shed. It felt cold 30 ______the touch. Well, not exactly cold, more cool and smooth. It was fashioned like no other stone that Tanon had ever seen. He was fascinated by it and it 31 ______ his gaze like a venomous snake did its prey, just before making its lethal strike. Yet there was no strike – just the beautiful curves of this most precious of objects. At least, Tanon presumed it was precious, but now he had a decision to 32 ______. Should he take it immediately to his master or could he hold 33 ______ to its smoothness for just a little longer? A clap of thunder broke his daydream and he turned his gaze heavenwards. Dark clouds were forming 34 ______ smoke billowing from an open fire and Tanon knew he had not much time before the rain came. He had to get the cattle inside before the full force of the storm came to bear down on the farm. 35 ______ as he was standing up, his prize started to change. Swirling mists and patterns drifted over its outer layer and a pale pulsing light seemed to throb from its core. Tanon 36 ______ in wonder – was this some sort of magical object?
