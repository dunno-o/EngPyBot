He was trying and 35 _______________ to get some of his works published. On a whim, he sent his agent a manuscript with the title: “Percy Jackson and the Lightning Thief”, which very quickly got published.Rick Riordan got enough money from his first book to quit his teaching job and become a full-time writer. 36 _____________ then, he has written three more series based not only on Greek, but also on Roman, Egyptian, and Norse mythology.
