“Faithful” by Jane Bush 
“Faithful” is the final novel in the trilogy by Jane Bush. This powerful book pushes limits, breaks hearts and 30 _______ you think. It is much more complex than most young adult novels in its challenges of what is logical versus what is right. The novel 31 _______ a breathtaking story about the adventures of Tobias and Tris.Tobias reveals vulnerabilities I never would have guessed he had. I loved the half of the novel, which was told from his point of 32 _______; the darkness and desperation he fights against were so intense it hurt my heart.Tris’ side is less complicated and she doesn’t change much. However, she gains a deeper understanding of things, which in turn gives the reader 33 _______ a deeper understanding of the characters and their motivations.While I loved so many things in this book, the writing wasn’t as exciting as in the previous novels, at 34 _______ not for me and not in the beginning. Towards the middle it gained more intensity and the pace picked up, and by the end I was on the edge of my seat.The end was perfect not just on the characters’ parts, but on the author’s as well. It was an ending that left me 35 _______ earlier scenes with revelation that it was all leading to this. Jane Bush has definitely 36 _______ in creating an unforgettable world to discover.
