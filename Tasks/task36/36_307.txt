Raindrops spattered the windshield as the taxi sliced through 30 ______ traffic on Park Avenue. There were too many cars as usual. When it had skidded to a halt at the curb, Bo gave a ten-dollar bill to the driver. That included a very generous tip. He 31 ______ his point of destination and was ready to take on Frank Ramsey. He had called Ramsey that morning from the Yale club and demanded the meeting. Ramsey had tried to avoid it but Bo insisted and Ramsey gave 32 ______ . At the building’s revolving doors, Bo glanced back over his shoulder through the rain and noticed a woman standing on the sidewalk a short distance away. In the dim light he could not get a clear picture. She 33 ______ so much like Tiffany. She was wearing a yellow top and had long blond hair. Standing absolutely 34 ______ beneath her umbrella while everything around her moved, she seemed to be gazing straight at him. His heart 35 ______ , the way it always did when he saw her. He couldn’t help it. Bo strained to 36 ______ sight of her as he was jostled into the doorway. When he cleared the doors, the woman had already disappeared.
