William and Philippa 
William and Philippa were students. Some people, it is said, fall in love at first 30 ________, but that was not what happened to them. They hated each other from the moment they met. This mutual hatred began at the first tutorial of their freshman term. Both had 31 ________ with major scholarships to read English language and literature. Each had been reliably assured by their schoolteachers that they would be the star pupil of their year. 32 ________ students had such prospects. Their tutor, Simon Jakes of New College, was amused by the competition that so quickly developed between his two brightest pupils. He skillfully used their hatred to bring out the best in both of them. He never 33 ________ it. By the end of their first year, they were far ahead of other students. In their second year, they became even more hostile. When they were both awarded A-plus for their essays on Shakespeare, it didn't help. Simon Jakes told his colleagues that he had never had a brighter pair up in the same year. They taught each other most of the time and he 34 ________ acted as a referee. It 35 ________ as no surprise to anyone that, as the examiners felt unable on this occasion to award the prize to just one person, they 36 ________ decided that it should be shared by William and Philippa.
