Let me tell you what happened once when my dear Uncle Podger decided to hang a picture on the wall. He told us not to 30 ______ and just watch him do it. He said he would do it by himself. Well, he came up to the picture which was waiting to be put up in the dining room and took it. But suddenly it fell down and the glass 31 ______ into pieces and he cut his finger. He started to 32 ______ his handkerchief but couldn’t find it because he had put it in his coat and none of us knew where his coat was. ‘Six of you!’ Uncle Podger exclaimed, ‘and you cannot find the coat that I put down only five minutes ago!’ But then he got up from his chair and found that he had been sitting on his coat the whole time. ‘Oh, you can stop your 33 ______ . I’ve found it myself!’ Then after an hour was spent in tying up his finger Uncle Podger wondered where the hammer had disappeared to. And while everybody was trying to get the hammer he was standing on the chair saying: ‘Well, I want to know if you are going to 34 ______ me here all evening!’ Finally the hammer was found, but we noticed that the nail which he had prepared was lost. And, of course, Uncle Podger didn’t keep 35 ______ while he was waiting for another nail to be brought. We heard all he had to say about our habit of losing all the things he needed. When the picture was hanging on the wall at last, everybody looked very 36 ______ , all except Uncle Podg er, who was lively as ever. Aunt Maria remarked that if Uncle Podger wanted to do a job like that again, she would spend a week with her mother until it was over.
