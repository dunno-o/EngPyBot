Mausoleum of Mausolus
The Mausoleum of Halicarnassus (present Bodrum, Turkey) was a tomb built in 350 BC for king Mausolus and Artemisia, his wife. In 377 BC, Halicarnassus was the capital of a small regional kingdom on the coast of Anatolia. In that year the ruler of the region died and left the kingdom to his son, Mausolus. Before his death the father king 30 ______ control of several of the neighboring cities and districts. Mausolus 31 ______ the territory of the kingdom as far as the southwest coast of Anatolia. Mausolus and Artemisia ruled from their capital over the surrounding territory 32 ______ twenty-four years. Mausolus, although he was descended from local people, spoke Greek and 33 ______ the Greek way of life and government. He founded many cities of Greek design along the coast and 34 ______ Greek democratic traditions. Mausolus decided to build a new capital, a city as safe from capture as magnificent to be seen. He chose the city of Halicarnassus. Mausolus and Artemisia spent huge 35 ______ of tax money to embellish the city. They commissioned statues, temples and buildings of gleaming marble. In the center of the city Mausolus planned to place a resting place for his body after his death. It would be a tomb that would forever show how rich he and his queen were. In 353 BC Mausolus died, leaving Artemisia broken-hearted. As a tribute to him, she decided to build him the most splendid tomb, a structure so famous that it became one of the Seven Wonders of the 36 ______ World.
