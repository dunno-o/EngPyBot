Land!
On September 30, 1492, sailors on three ships, the Pinta, the Niña, and the Santa Maria, were worried. They had left the shores of Spain weeks 30 ______. No one knew what 31 ______ ahead. They hoped that they would see land soon, but land was nowhere 32 ______ sight. Then their luck changed. They began to notice signs of land. First they saw a large flock of birds flying overhead. They even heard the birds call out. Then the 33 ______ of the Pinta spotted green reeds floating in the water. Sailors on the other ship also began to see signs of land. The sailors began to have more hope. Christopher Columbus was the leader of the group. He urged the sailors to be more watchful than ever. He 34 ______ them to fire a cannon when they spotted land. Then at ten o’clock at night on October 11, Columbus saw a light. Columbus did not trust his own 35 ______. He knew his strong desire to reach land might be causing his imagination to run wild. He asked two other men if they saw the light. The first man 36 ______ to see the light, but the second one did not. The Moon rose before midnight and lit the water. With their eyes scanning the water, the sailors on all three ships watched silently. Two hours later everyone heard the blast of cannon. The men on the Pinta had seen land. All the men cheered.
