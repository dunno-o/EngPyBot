The Best Breakfast in the World
The “Greasy Spoon” cafe on Arundel Road offers the best full English breakfast on the planet. Of course people 30 ______ about what “full English” should consist of but I think there is a small clue in the word “full”. This is a breakfast that knows no modesty. This is not a breakfast for those on a diet. It is the breakfast of Kings; it should be enjoyed 31 ______ leisure and last for the day. That the “full English” (FE) contains both bacon and eggs is 32 ______ dispute. After this there are different schools of thought. Sausage, mushrooms, beans, black pudding, fried tomatoes and toast are often 33 ______ in different line ups and combinations competing for the best, all time classic FE. These are 34 ______ in different portions and styles and a decent breakfast is the almost guaranteed outcome. But an FE on Arundel Road beats all contenders for the best FE in the world because it includes ALL of these ingredients in 35 ______ quantities! They also serve hot toast on traditional toast racks with real butter. But best of all, each customer is served their own pot of traditional English tea (with tea cozy) which may be drunk with milk or cream. And all of this is offered for just £5 per person  — and with a newspaper included! The Greasy Spoon is popular with working people and students alike. It opens early during the week for the lorry drivers and on Sunday mornings 36 ______ families come in and spend half the day there.
