Two years in a hut
Henry Thompson, a writer, built a hut on the shore of the pond and lived there all alone for two years. He did this for two reasons: because he wanted to 30 ______ that people spend too much time and money on food and clothes and because he wanted a perfectly quiet chance to write more books. 31 ______ to the writer, he spent only one hundred dollars a year while he lived in this hut. He raised beans on his land, ate wild berries, caught fish and “went visiting” his friends and neighbours now and then. To buy his woodsman’s clothes and a few necessities, he planted gardens, painted houses, and cut wood for his friends.This period influenced Henry’s creative work a lot. He wrote a book called “The Wood” which 32 ______ all about these seven or eight hundred days he lived in his hut. Several other books also describe the time when he 33 ______ to live all by himself. These sold very well. In all of them Henry was boasting that he had found the only sensible way to live. “I am for simple living, and I 34 ______ being alone!” he would declare in his books. He 35 ______ you feel, when you read his books, that it is fine to walk around the fields, sniffing the wild grape and the green grass, and that no one can find pleasure like the man who rows, and skates, and swims. 36 ______, people passing by the pond used to hear him whistling old ballads, or playing very softly and beautifully on a flute, and they thought he sounded lonely and sad.
