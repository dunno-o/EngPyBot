As a small child I loved almost everything about Christmas. The excitement of Christmas Eve was almost unbearable. We’d go from house to house singing Christmas carols and be given hot mince pies and other 30 ______ Before bed our parents would read us stories and eventually put us to bed with warnings that Santa Claus would not come if we stayed awake. Before 31 ______ into bed we would leave out a mince pie for Santa and something for his reindeers as a “thank you”: For me Santa was the great hero and I never 32 ______ that he would come down our chimney to deliver my presents. I loved, as I mentioned before, “almost everything”. Immediately after Christmas I was told by my parents that I had to write “thank you letters”.

As I eventually solved this annual mystery, I of course lost all 36 ______ for not writing the “Thank you letters” as the realisation dawned that Granddad had managed everything by himself.
