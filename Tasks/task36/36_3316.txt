Amy 
It was Christmas Eve. Amy had never before felt such a powerful energy on such an 30 _______.Standing in the living room of the ranch house, Amy 31 _______ where Paul Chadwick really lived, since it was apparent he did not live there. Paul and Anna had not put much of a mark on the apartment, Amy reflected. The apartment was handsome but impersonal. She knew that the places where he was supposed to live were too tidy, too sleek, they 32 _______ like hotel suites. He had an office in the Towers apartment and one here, and in those she could see some marks of the man; but she saw none in the living rooms, dining rooms and bedrooms.The décor was resolutely Western, its furnishings assembled to 33 _______ the effect. Only one item said something. Above the huge smoke-stained fieldstone fireplace here was a small photograph, a snapshot, actually, of a grim, solid man in his sixties. He wore a no-nonsense expression, glaring disapprovingly at the world but not at the photographer. If you knew what you were looking 34 _______ in the picture, or used a magnifying glass, you could identify a bottle of bourbon on the desk. On a table at his side were two candlestick telephones. That was Paul Chadwick the First. Amy 35 _______ to John and his sister Emily and said, ”Your father is not what I imagined he would be.” Amy had seen pictures of Paul Chadwick, so his appearance was no surprise. What she had not seen in his newspaper and magazine pictures was that he was aggressive, beyond doubt, but 36 _______ that he was easily, naturally charismatic.
