A trip to Thailand
I have always been interested in various cultures especially those completely alien to us. Thus, imagine my delight when my father 30 ______ me that he was taking us on a holiday to Bangkok and from there to visit a remote tribe that lives about 200 kilometers north of the capital city. As my father explained, the tribe lives an isolated life and the members are cut 31 ______ from the rest of the world in terms of their unique and even weird cultural practices.During our trip I have noticed that the Thai people are very friendly and their greetings are very 32 ______ to the Indians’. For example, when they meet you they bring their palms together in a prayer-like position and bend their bodies a little as a way of welcoming and acknowledging you. It would definitely 33 ______ you feel as an honored guest. At first, I was rather 34 ______ by these greeting traditions which seemed so unusual and respectful to me. Surprisingly, soon I got used to doing that myself and 35 ______ this procedure during my entire trip to Thailand. We spent only two fantastic days in Bangkok before heading 36 ______ the remote village which was going to be the most exciting time of our lives, dad promised. We were excited and could not wait seeing everything with our own eyes!
