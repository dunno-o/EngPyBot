Tracey and her sister had always wanted their own horse. And although neither of them had much spare money, they were about to 30 ______ their dream. The tricky part was not getting a horse but actually finding somewhere to keep one. But eventually Mrs. Richards agreed to let the girls 31 ______ a small field at the far end of the farm. This was going to 32 ______ them £500 a year but it would work out at just over 20 pounds per month each which was OK. The horse himself was coming from the Horse Rescue Charity. They would need to make a small donationevery year to cover the cost of an animal welfare inspector who would visit twice a year. The 33 ______ expenses after this would be for food and vet bills. But the two girls were 34 ______ that they could manage and were committed to going ahead. And it was a big commitment. They were getting an eighteen month old skewbald colt named Domino. Horses often live over twenty years and the sisters were taking him on 35 ______ life. Actually they had plans to get another horse as a friend for Domino. But first of all Domino would need to settle down. He had been badly treated by his previous owners and was still a bit nervous and difficult to 36 ______ .
