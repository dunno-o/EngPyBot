An unforgettable trip
When I decided to go travelling, I wanted to get away from everything for a while. I could suddenly feel the freedom and the adventure, and I really wanted it for a 30 ______ time. So I sold all my furniture, gave notice on my flat, quit my job, and then bought a backpack and a ticket halfway around the world. During my first stopover in Singapore, on my way to Australia, I felt nervous. I sat tired and hungry in my hotel room, 31 ______ with my wish to take a flight straight back home. Because if I felt lonely after 32 ______ 14 hours, could I honestly do this for another 12 months? Fortunately, something inside encouraged me not to 33 ______ up and to see the night through, and I carried on.One of my worries setting out had been meeting rude people, but I didn’t come across a single unkind person on my travels. In fact, the people I met were everything I tried to be: kind, considerate, creative, down to earth, passionate, warm and friendly. 34 ______ I travelled on my own, I was never alone – all the people I met became my friends. For example, one Italian girl gave me her jumper when I was cold, a Japanese girl helped me cook a meal, and another girl helped me with my bags on a train. Once I met a group on a tour bus who persuaded me to 35 ______ them on a boat trip, which ended up being one of the best trips of my life. And the guy I met 36 ______ chance walking down a mountain on Christmas Day is now one of my closest friends.
