He visualized his photo many years ago, when Iberian wolves first returned to Vila in the Castillo у Leon region of northern Spain, and cattle ranchers 31 ______ war on them. His idea was a picture that would symbolize the ancient conflict 32 ______ humans and wolves, while showing the beauty and strength of this fabled animal. But it took a long time to find the ideal 33 ______ , let alone a wolf that would jump a gate. His chance came when he found a landowner who was happy to have both the wolves and Jos6 Luis on his property, and also had the ideal setting: a copse and an ancient, disused cattle corral. Jose Luis started by placing meat in the corral. Once he knew a male wolf was visiting regularly, jumping the gate, he began to introduce the bits of equipment needed to 34 ______ up a camera trap.

Now that the wolf was happy and the camera 36 ______ was right, it was time to take the final picture with a medium-format camera. When the first transparencies arrived back from the lab, Josё Luis was overjoyed to find he finally had the picture he had dreamt of.
