Taming Birds
The most amazing thing happened this morning. I still can’t believe it! Everyone knows how much I love feeding birds. In fact, I have several feeders around the yard. So, today, just as I was 30 ______ to fill one of my feeders, I noticed a chickadee perched on the lower branch of a 31 ______ tree. The little bird seemed to be watching me. Of course, chickadees really like sunflower seeds, and that’s what I always put in this feeder. I 32 ______ it was probably hungry and just waiting for me to finish up and leave. It was then that I got this great idea. Chickadees are supposed to be easy to hand-tame. Well, the chickadee was still perched on the tree, and I had the seeds, so I decided to try. I took a 33 ______ of seeds, held out my hand  — palm up  — next to the feeder and stood very still. I didn’t even 34 ______ my nose when it started to itch! About a minute later, the chickadee flew to the tree closest to the feeder. I 35 ______ my breath and waited. It didn’t fly to my hand, but it did fly to the feeder! It took a seed and flew off to eat it. I knew it would be back, so I continued to watch and wait. And sure 36 ______, in about half an hour of patient waiting my stubbornness was rewarded and the chickadee landed on my hand!
