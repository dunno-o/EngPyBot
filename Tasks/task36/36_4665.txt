Dirty Job? Oh Yeah!“You couldn’t pay me to do that job!” Have you ever said that? Some occupations are so unpleasant that most people would never be 30 ______ to do them. Jeff Biggs has a job like that, but he likes it. He’s the kind of guy who, as a kid, loved to play around in mud after a rainstorm, the kind of kid who loved squeezing oatmeal 31 ______ his fingers. Bigg’s dirty job is being a sewer inspector. He inspects city sewer pipes that carry household wastewater and storm-drain runoff to water treatment plants. “Believe me,” says Biggs, “unpleasant doesn’t come 32 ______ to describing it. I creep, sometimes swim, through sewage all day.” 33 ______ to the unpleasant smells that he encounters, sewer tunnels are 34 ______ to creatures such as cockroaches and rats. And those creatures aren’t shy. What is it like to do a really disgusting job day after day? “Someone has to do it,” says Biggs. “I seriously can’t imagine sitting in an office all day, and I earn a good salary. At the end of my workday, I’ve 35 ______ something, and I’ve helped to keep our city’s water clean and drinkable.” And after work? “I don’t walk into the house right 36 ______,” explains Biggs. “We installed the washing machine in the garage and put a shower stall in there too. I toss my clothes into the washer, take a shower, and dress in clean clothes. Then I greet my family. Of course, sometimes the clothes go into the trash, not the washer.”
