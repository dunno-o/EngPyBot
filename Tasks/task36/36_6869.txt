The man on the trail
It was a cold grey day when the man walked into the main Yukon trail. He climbed the snow-covered river bank where a trail went through the pine forest. It was a high bank, and the man paused to breathe at the top and 30 _______ at the sky. It was nine o’clock in the morning. There was no sun or even the promise of sunshine, 31 _______ there was not a cloud in the sky. It was a clear day, but the sun was absent from the sky. This fact did not worry the man because he could hardly 32 _______ a day when he had seen the sun.The man had come a long way alone, and he was really proud 33 _______ himself. The old man from the village warned him how cold it sometimes got in this country. He said that no man should travel alone in this season.

It led south 500 miles to the Chilcoot Pass. It led north 75 miles to Dawson and still farther on to the north a thousand miles more. However, all this – the distant trail, no sun in the sky, and the great cold – had no 35 _______ on the man. It was not because he was long 36 _______ with it. On the contrary, he was a newcomer in the land, and this was his first winter.
