The Great Discovery
In ancient times people lived on whatever food they could find. As the early people 30 ______ in numbers, they had to wander and search for wild fruits and seeds of wild plants or hunt for small animals.  Then one of these early people 31 ______ a great discovery. A great genius discovered the meaning of seeds. He may have noticed that where some seeds had fallen on the ground, new plants grew. Perhaps he was 32 ______ enough to put some seeds in the ground to see what would happen. No one knows how it happened, but man 33 ______ that if he put a seed into the soil it could grow into a plant which might yield hundreds or even thousands of seeds! He was free of the need to be in a constant search of his food! Early man could now 34 _____ seeds in the spring and wait for them to grow. In the fall he could gather a harvest of seeds. There would be enough to 35 ______ himself and his family all through the winter, with some left over for planting when spring came. This discovery was the beginning of 36 ______ and the most important change that ever happened to people on earth.
