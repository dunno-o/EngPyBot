Treasure Not TrashCollage is a well-practiced and popular form of art. It appears in all kinds of media that artists may work in today, including the 25_________ formats. Collage combines colour and texture of 26_________ items that are often 27_________ to each other. You can make a self-portrait, a picture of a 28_________ pet, or a scene using collage as the format. It is good to be kind to the environment, too, and to use things that are recyclable. Things that are deemed 29_________ trash and scrap make great art for those with a 30_________ goal in mind!
